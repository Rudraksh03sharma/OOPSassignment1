        "#**Q1->What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n",
        "#**Sol->**\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which are instances of **classes**. It focuses on structuring software by bundling data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) together into objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Concepts of OOP**\n",
        "1. **Classes & Objects**  \n",
        "   - A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of an object.\n",
        "   - An **object** is an instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Encapsulation**  \n",
        "   - Encapsulation is the practice of keeping data (attributes) private inside a class and only allowing access through public methods.  \n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Car:\n",
        "         def __init__(self, brand):\n",
        "             self.__brand = brand  # Private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "         def get_brand(self):\n",
        "             return self.__brand  # Public method to access private data\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**  \n",
        "   - A class can **inherit** attributes and methods from another class, allowing for code reuse and organization.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Vehicle:\n",
        "         def move(self):\n",
        "             print(\"This vehicle is moving\")\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Car(Vehicle):  # Car inherits from Vehicle\n",
        "         pass\n",
        "\n",
        "     my_car = Car()\n",
        "     my_car.move()  # Output: This vehicle is moving\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**  \n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as the same type through a common interface, enabling method overriding.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     class Animal:\n",
        "         def make_sound(self):\n",
        "             pass\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "         def make_sound(self):\n",
        "             return \"Woof!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "         def make_sound(self):\n",
        "             return \"Meow!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     for animal in [Dog(), Cat()]:\n",
        "         print(animal.make_sound())\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Abstraction**  \n",
        "   - Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential features.\n",
        "   - Example using Python's **ABC (Abstract Base Class)**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "     class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "         @abstractmethod\n",
        "         def make_sound(self):\n",
